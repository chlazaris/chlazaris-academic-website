 abstract = {​Heat-shock factor 1 (​HSF1) orchestrates the heat-shock response in eukaryotes. Although this pathway has evolved to help cells adapt in the presence of challenging conditions, it is co-opted in cancer to support malignancy. However, the mechanisms that regulate ​HSF1 and thus cellular stress response are poorly understood. Here we show that the ubiquitin ligase ​FBXW7α interacts with ​HSF1 through a conserved motif phosphorylated by ​GSK3β and ​ERK1. ​FBXW7α ubiquitylates ​HSF1 and loss of ​FBXW7α results in impaired degradation of nuclear ​HSF1 and defective heat-shock response attenuation. ​FBXW7α is either mutated or transcriptionally downregulated in melanoma and ​HSF1 nuclear stabilization correlates with increased metastatic potential and disease progression. ​FBXW7α deficiency and subsequent ​HSF1 accumulation activates an invasion-supportive transcriptional program and enhances the metastatic potential of human melanoma cells. These findings identify a post-translational mechanism of regulation of the ​HSF1 transcriptional program both in the presence of exogenous stress and in cancer.},
