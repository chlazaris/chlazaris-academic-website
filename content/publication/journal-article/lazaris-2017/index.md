abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Chromatin conformation capture techniques have evolved rapidly
  over the last few years and have provided new insights into genome organization
  at an unprecedented resolution. Analysis of Hi-C data is complex and computationally
  intensive involving multiple tasks and requiring robust quality assessment. This
  has led to the development of several tools and methods for processing Hi-C data.
  However, most of the existing tools do not cover all aspects of the analysis and
  only offer few quality assessment options. Additionally, availability of a multitude
  of tools makes scientists wonder how these tools and associated parameters can be
  optimally used, and how potential discrepancies can be interpreted and resolved.
  Most importantly, investigators need to be ensured that slight changes in parameters
  and/or methods do not affect the conclusions of their studies. RESULTS: To address
  these issues (compare, explore and reproduce), we introduce HiC-bench, a configurable
  computational platform for comprehensive and reproducible analysis of Hi-C sequencing
  data. HiC-bench performs all common Hi-C analysis tasks, such as alignment, filtering,
  contact matrix generation and normalization, identification of topological domains,
  scoring and annotation of specific interactions using both published tools and our
  own. We have also embedded various tasks that perform quality assessment and visualization.
  HiC-bench is implemented as a data flow platform with an emphasis on analysis reproducibility.
  Additionally, the user can readily perform parameter exploration and comparison
  of different tools in a combinatorial manner that takes into account all desired
  parameter settings in each pipeline task. This unique feature facilitates the design
  and execution of complex benchmark studies that may involve combinations of multiple
  tool/parameter choices in each step of the analysis. To demonstrate the usefulness
  of our platform, we performed a comprehensive benchmark of existing and new TAD
  callers exploring different matrix correction methods, parameter settings and sequencing
  depths. Users can extend our pipeline by adding more tools as they become available.
  CONCLUSIONS: HiC-bench consists an easy-to-use and extensible platform for comprehensive
  analysis of Hi-C datasets. We expect that it will facilitate current analyses and
  help scientists formulate and test new hypotheses in the field of three-dimensional
  genome organization.'
