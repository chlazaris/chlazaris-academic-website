abstract: Mounting evidence links genetic lesions with genome topology alterations
  and aberrant gene activation. However, the role of epigenetic plasticity remains
  elusive. Emerging studies implicate DNA methylation, transcriptional elongation,
  long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)-RNA interactions,
  but systematic approaches are needed to fully decipher the role of epigenetic plasticity
  in genome integrity and function. Copyright oÌ§pyright 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights
