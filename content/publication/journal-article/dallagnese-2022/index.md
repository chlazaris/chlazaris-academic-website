abstract: Insulin receptor (IR) signaling is central to normal metabolic control and
  is dysregulated in metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. We report here that
  IR is incorporated into dynamic clusters at the plasma membrane, in the cytoplasm
  and in the nucleus of human hepatocytes and adipocytes. Insulin stimulation promotes
  further incorporation of IR into these dynamic clusters in insulin-sensitive cells
  but not in insulin-resistant cells, where both IR accumulation and dynamic behavior
  are reduced. Treatment of insulin-resistant cells with metformin, a first-line drug
  used to treat type 2 diabetes, can rescue IR accumulation and the dynamic behavior
  of these clusters. This rescue is associated with metformin's role in reducing reactive
  oxygen species that interfere with normal dynamics. These results indicate that
  changes in the physico-mechanical features of IR clusters contribute to insulin
  resistance and have implications for improved therapeutic approaches. oÌ§pyright
