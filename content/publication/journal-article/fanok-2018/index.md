abstract: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a heterogeneous group of lymphomas characterized
  by the accumulation of malignant T cells in the skin. The molecular and cellular
  etiology of this malignancy remains enigmatic, and what role antigenic stimulation
  plays in the initiation and/or progression of the disease remains to be elucidated.
  Deep sequencing of the tumor genome showed a highly heterogeneous landscape of genetic
  perturbations, and transcriptome analysis of transformed T cells further highlighted
  the heterogeneity of this disease. Nonetheless, using data harvested from high-throughput
  transcriptional profiling allowed us to develop a reliable signature of this malignancy.
  Focusing on a key cytokine signaling pathway previously implicated in cutaneous
  T-cell lymphoma pathogenesis, JAK/STAT signaling, we used conditional gene targeting
  to develop a fully penetrant small animal model of this disease that recapitulates
  many key features of mycosis fungoides, a common variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
  Using this mouse model, we show that T-cell receptor engagement is critical for
  malignant transformation of the T lymphocytes and that progression of the disease
  is dependent on microbiota. Copyright o̧pyright 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier
