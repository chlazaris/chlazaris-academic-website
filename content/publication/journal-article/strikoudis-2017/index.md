abstract: Maintenance of stem cell plasticity is determined by the ability to balance
  opposing forces that control gene expression. Regulation of transcriptional networks,
  signaling cues and chromatin-modifying mechanisms constitute crucial determinants
  of tissue equilibrium. Histone modifications can affect chromatin compaction, therefore
  co-transcriptional events that influence their deposition determine the propensities
  toward quiescence, self-renewal, or cell specification. The Paf1 complex (Paf1C)
  is a critical regulator of RNA PolII elongation that controls gene expression and
  deposition of histone modifications, however few studies have focused on its role
  affecting stem cell fate decisions. Here we delineate the functions of Paf1C in
  pluripotency and characterize its impact in deposition of H2B ubiquitylation (H2BK120-ub)
  and H3K79 methylation (H3K79me), 2 fundamental histone marks that shape transcriptional
  regulation. We identify that H2BK120-ub is increased in the absence of Paf1C on
  its embryonic stem cell targets, in sharp contrast to H3K79me, suggesting opposite
  functions in the maintenance of self-renewal. Furthermore, we found that core pluripotency
  genes are characterized by a dual gain of H2BK120-ub and loss of H3K79me on their
  gene bodies. Our findings elucidate molecular mechanisms of cellular adaptation
  and reveal novel functions of Paf1C in the regulation of the self-renewal network.
