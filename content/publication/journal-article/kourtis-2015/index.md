abstract: ​Heat-shock factor 1 (​HSF1) orchestrates the heat-shock response in eukaryotes.
  Although this pathway has evolved to help cells adapt in the presence of challenging
  conditions, it is co-opted in cancer to support malignancy. However, the mechanisms
  that regulate ​HSF1 and thus cellular stress response are poorly understood. Here
  we show that the ubiquitin ligase ​FBXW7α interacts with ​HSF1 through a conserved
  motif phosphorylated by ​GSK3β and ​ERK1. ​FBXW7α ubiquitylates ​HSF1 and loss of
  ​FBXW7α results in impaired degradation of nuclear ​HSF1 and defective heat-shock
  response attenuation. ​FBXW7α is either mutated or transcriptionally downregulated
  in melanoma and ​HSF1 nuclear stabilization correlates with increased metastatic
  potential and disease progression. ​FBXW7α deficiency and subsequent ​HSF1 accumulation
  activates an invasion-supportive transcriptional program and enhances the metastatic
  potential of human melanoma cells. These findings identify a post-translational
  mechanism of regulation of the ​HSF1 transcriptional program both in the presence
  of exogenous stress and in cancer.
