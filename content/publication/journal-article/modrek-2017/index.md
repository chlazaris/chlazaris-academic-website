abstract: Low-grade astrocytomas (LGAs) carry neomorphic mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase
  (IDH) concurrently with P53 and ATRX loss. To model LGA formation, we introduced
  R132H IDH1, P53 shRNA, and ATRX shRNA into human neural stem cells (NSCs). These
  oncogenic hits blocked NSC differentiation, increased invasiveness in vivo, and
  led to a DNA methylation and transcriptional profile resembling IDH1 mutant human
  LGAs. The differentiation block was caused by transcriptional silencing of the transcription
  factor SOX2 secondary to disassociation of its promoter from a putative enhancer.
  This occurred because of reduced binding of the chromatin organizer CTCF to its
  DNA motifs and disrupted chromatin looping. Our human model of IDH mutant LGA formation
  implicates impaired NSC differentiation because of repression of SOX2 as an early
  driver of gliomagenesis. Copyright o̧pyright 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier
