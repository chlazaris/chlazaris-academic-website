abstract: 'A substantial fraction of patients with stage I-III colorectal adenocarcinoma
  (CRC) experience disease relapse after surgery with curative intent. However, biomarkers
  for predicting the likelihood of CRC relapse have not been fully explored. Therefore,
  we assessed the association between tumor infiltration by a broad array of innate
  and adaptive immune cell types and CRC relapse risk. We implemented a discovery-validation
  design including a discovery dataset from Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC; Tampa, FL)
  and three independent validation datasets: (1) GSE41258 (2) the Molecular Epidemiology
  of Colorectal Cancer (MECC) study, and (3) GSE39582. Infiltration by 22 immune cell
  types was inferred from tumor gene expression data, and the association between
  immune infiltration by each cell type and relapse-free survival was assessed using
  Cox proportional hazards regression. Within each of the four independent cohorts,
  CD4+ memory activated T cell (HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.90-0.96; FDR = 0.0001) infiltration
  was associated with longer time to disease relapse, independent of stage, microsatellite
  instability, and adjuvant therapy. Based on our meta-analysis across the four datasets,
  10 innate and adaptive immune cell types associated with disease relapse of which
  2 were internally validated using multiplex immunofluorescence. Moreover, immune
  cell type infiltration was a better predictors of disease relapse than Consensus
  Molecular Subtype (CMS) and other expression-based biomarkers (Immune-AICMCC:238.1-238.9;
  CMS-AICMCC: 241.0). These data suggest that transcriptome-derived immune profiles
  are prognostic indicators of CRC relapse and quantification of both innate and adaptive
  immune cell types may serve as candidate biomarkers for predicting prognosis and
  guiding frequency and modality of disease surveillance. o̧pyright 2021 The Author(s).
