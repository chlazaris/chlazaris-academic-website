abstract: Regulation of biological processes typically incorporates mechanisms that
  initiate and terminate the process and, where understood, these mechanisms often
  involve feedback control. Regulation of transcription is a fundamental cellular
  process where the mechanisms involved in initiation have been studied extensively,
  but those involved in arresting the process are poorly understood. Modeling of the
  potential roles of RNA in transcriptional control suggested a non-equilibrium feedback
  control mechanism where low levels of RNA promote condensates formed by electrostatic
  interactions whereas relatively high levels promote dissolution of these condensates.
  Evidence from in vitro and in vivo experiments support a model where RNAs produced
  during early steps in transcription initiation stimulate condensate formation, whereas
  the burst of RNAs produced during elongation stimulate condensate dissolution. We
  propose that transcriptional regulation incorporates a feedback mechanism whereby
  transcribed RNAs initially stimulate but then ultimately arrest the process. Copyright
