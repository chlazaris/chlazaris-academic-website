abstract: The metazoan genome is compartmentalized in areas of highly interacting
  chromatin known as topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs are demarcated
  by boundaries mostly conserved across cell types and even across species. However,
  a genome-wide characterization of TAD boundary strength in mammals is still lacking.
  In this study, we first use fused two-dimensional lasso as a machine learning method
  to improve Hi-C contact matrix reproducibility, and, subsequently, we categorize
  TAD boundaries based on their insulation score. We demonstrate that higher TAD boundary
  insulation scores are associated with elevated CTCF levels and that they may differ
  across cell types. Intriguingly, we observe that super-enhancers are preferentially
  insulated by strong boundaries. Furthermore, we demonstrate that strong TAD boundaries
  and super-enhancer elements are frequently co-duplicated in cancer patients. Taken
  together, our findings suggest that super-enhancers insulated by strong TAD boundaries
  may be exploited, as a functional unit, by cancer cells to promote oncogenesis.
