abstract: Differences in three-dimensional (3D) chromatin architecture can influence
  the integrity of topologically associating domains (TADs) and rewire specific enhancer-promoter
  interactions, impacting gene expression and leading to human disease. Here we investigate
  the 3D chromatin architecture in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) by
  using primary human leukemia specimens and examine the dynamic responses of this
  architecture to pharmacological agents. Systematic integration of matched in situ
  Hi-C, RNA-seq and CTCF ChIP-seq datasets revealed widespread differences in intra-TAD
  chromatin interactions and TAD boundary insulation in T-ALL. Our studies identify
  and focus on a TAD 'fusion' event associated with absence of CTCF-mediated insulation,
  enabling direct interactions between the MYC promoter and a distal super-enhancer.
  Moreover, our data also demonstrate that small-molecule inhibitors targeting either
  oncogenic signal transduction or epigenetic regulation can alter specific 3D interactions
  found in leukemia. Overall, our study highlights the impact, complexity and dynamic
  nature of 3D chromatin architecture in human acute leukemia.
