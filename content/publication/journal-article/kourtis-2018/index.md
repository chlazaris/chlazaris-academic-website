abstract: Cellular transformation is accompanied by extensive rewiring of many biological
  processes leading to augmented levels of distinct types of cellular stress, including
  proteotoxic stress. Cancer cells critically depend on stress-relief pathways for
  their survival. However, the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional initiation
  and maintenance of the oncogenic stress response remain elusive. Here, we show that
  the expression of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and the downstream mediators
  of the heat shock response is transcriptionally upregulated in T cell acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia (T-ALL). Hsf1 ablation suppresses the growth of human T-ALL and eradicates
  leukemia in mouse models of T-ALL, while sparing normal hematopoiesis. HSF1 drives
  a compact transcriptional program and among the direct HSF1 targets, specific chaperones
  and co-chaperones mediate its critical role in T-ALL. Notably, we demonstrate that
  the central T-ALL oncogene NOTCH1 hijacks the cellular stress response machinery
  by inducing the expression of HSF1 and its downstream effectors. The NOTCH1 signaling
  status controls the levels of chaperone/co-chaperone complexes and predicts the
  response of T-ALL patient samples to HSP90 inhibition. Our data demonstrate an integral
  crosstalk between mediators of oncogene and non-oncogene addiction and reveal critical
  nodes of the heat shock response pathway that can be targeted therapeutically.
